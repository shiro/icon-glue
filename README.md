# Icon Glue

Keep custom icons on windows, even after software updates (I'm looking at you Ad*be).

# Usage

Simply run whenever your icons have been reverted.

All icons will be set according to the manifest.

# Install

- Put folder anywhere
- Edit icon folder path in `glue.sh`
- Edit `icon_manifest.csv` to match your icons
